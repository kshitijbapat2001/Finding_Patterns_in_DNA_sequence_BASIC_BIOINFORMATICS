# DNA Pattern Analysis Tool

## Overview
This Python-based DNA Pattern Analysis Tool is designed for bioinformatics researchers and students to analyze DNA sequences in FASTA format. The tool provides various functions for identifying patterns, calculating sequence compositions, and analyzing structural elements in DNA sequences.

## Features
- FASTA file parsing
- Pattern/motif finding
- GC content calculation
- Repeat sequence identification
- Palindromic sequence detection
- Base composition analysis

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only Python standard library)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dna-pattern-analysis.git
cd dna-pattern-analysis
```

2. The tool is ready to use with Python's standard library.

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from dna_analysis import read_fasta, analyze_sequence

# Read sequences from a FASTA file
sequences = read_fasta("path/to/your/sequence.fasta")

# Analyze each sequence
for seq_id, sequence in sequences.items():
    analysis = analyze_sequence(seq_id, sequence)
    # Process results as needed
```

### Input File Format
The tool accepts FASTA format files. Example:
```
>Sequence_ID_1
ATGCTAGCTAGCTGATCGATCG
>Sequence_ID_2
GCTAGCTAGCTAGCTGATCGAT
```

### Available Functions

#### read_fasta(file_path)
Reads a FASTA file and returns sequences as a dictionary.
```python
sequences = read_fasta("sequence.fasta")
```

#### find_motif(sequence, motif)
Finds all occurrences of a specific motif in a sequence.
```python
positions = find_motif("ATCGATCG", "ATC")
```

#### calculate_gc_content(sequence)
Calculates the GC content percentage in a sequence.
```python
gc_percent = calculate_gc_content("ATCGATCG")
```

#### find_repeats(sequence, min_length=4, min_count=2)
Identifies repeated sequences in DNA.
```python
repeats = find_repeats("ATCGATCGATCG", min_length=4, min_count=2)
```

#### find_palindromes(sequence, min_length=4, max_length=12)
Finds palindromic sequences in DNA.
```python
palindromes = find_palindromes("ATCGATCG")
```

#### analyze_sequence(sequence_id, sequence)
Performs comprehensive analysis of a DNA sequence.
```python
results = analyze_sequence("seq1", "ATCGATCG")
```

## Output Format
The analysis results are returned as a Python dictionary with the following structure:
```python
{
    'sequence_id': 'your_sequence_id',
    'length': integer,
    'gc_content': float,
    'repeats': {
        'repeat_sequence': [positions],
        ...
    },
    'palindromes': [
        (palindrome_sequence, position),
        ...
    ],
    'base_composition': {
        'A': count,
        'T': count,
        'G': count,
        'C': count
    }
}
```

## Example
```python
# Complete analysis example
from dna_analysis import read_fasta, analyze_sequence

# Read sequences
sequences = read_fasta("example.fasta")

# Analyze each sequence
for seq_id, sequence in sequences.items():
    analysis = analyze_sequence(seq_id, sequence)
    
    # Print results
    print(f"\nAnalysis for sequence: {seq_id}")
    print(f"Length: {analysis['length']} bp")
    print(f"GC Content: {analysis['gc_content']:.2f}%")
    
    print("\nBase Composition:")
    for base, count in analysis['base_composition'].items():
        print(f"{base}: {count}")
```

## Limitations
- The tool is designed for basic DNA sequence analysis
- Large sequences (>1MB) may require significant processing time
- Repeat finding algorithm may be memory-intensive for very long sequences
